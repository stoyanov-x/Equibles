# MCP Tools

Catalog of the MCP tools exposed by each `*.Mcp` project and the wiring path through [`Equibles.Mcp`](../../src/Equibles.Mcp) into [`Equibles.Mcp.Server`](../../src/Equibles.Mcp.Server). Names match what an AI assistant sees in `tools/list`.

## Wiring path

- [`EquiblesMcpBuilder`](../../src/Equibles.Mcp/EquiblesMcpBuilder.cs) wraps the MCP server builder and tracks registered modules + middleware.
- The MCP host calls [`services.AddEquiblesMcp(mcp => { ... })`](../../src/Equibles.Mcp/Extensions/ServiceCollectionExtensions.cs) once.
- That call invokes `services.AddMcpServer().WithHttpTransport()` and hands a fluent `EquiblesMcpBuilder` to the configuration lambda.
- Each module ships an `AddXxx(EquiblesMcpBuilder)` extension under `Equibles.<Module>.Mcp.Extensions.McpBuilderExtensions` that calls `builder.AddModule<AssemblyMcpModule<MarkerType>>()`.
- [`AssemblyMcpModule<TMarker>`](../../src/Equibles.Mcp/AssemblyMcpModule.cs) calls `builder.WithToolsFromAssembly(typeof(TMarker).Assembly)`.
- That call discovers every `[McpServerToolType]` class in the module assembly and registers its `[McpServerTool]`-attributed methods.
- The host pipeline mounts the transport at `/mcp` with `app.MapMcp("/mcp")`.
- [`ApiKeyMiddleware`](../../src/Equibles.Mcp/Middleware/ApiKeyMiddleware.cs) gates that path via `UseWhen(ctx.Request.Path.StartsWithSegments("/mcp"))`.

## Tool catalog

One section per module. Each tool name is exactly what the MCP client sees; the parenthetical class is the source file under `src/Equibles.<Module>.Mcp/Tools/`.

### `mcp.AddHoldings()` — institutional 13F-HR

`InstitutionalHoldingsTools`:

- `GetTopHolders` — top institutional holders of a given ticker for a `ReportDate`.
- `GetInstitutionalOwnershipHistory` — historical ownership trend (shares, value, holder count) per quarter.
- `GetInstitutionPortfolio` — full portfolio of one institution for a `ReportDate`.
- `SearchInstitutions` — punctuation-independent all-token name/CIK search with a sparse any-token fallback, largest within the recently-active 13F bucket first. Rows include CIK, latest report date, reported 13F AUM, tracked position count, and location. Verified flagship aliases include Fidelity/FMR, Vanguard, and BlackRock; institution-scoped tools stay strict, reject an ambiguous partial name, and return candidate CIKs.
- `GetTopInstitutionalBuyersSellers` — biggest absolute share additions and reductions for a ticker vs. the prior `ReportDate`; flags new and sold-out positions.
- `GetMarketWide13FActivity` — market-wide leaderboard for a quarter, selected by `bucket`: `top-buys`, `top-sells`, `new-positions`, `sold-out-positions`; Δ value includes the quarter's price move on held shares, so Δ shares is the position-change measure.
- `GetInstitutionSummary` — portfolio header for one filer at a `ReportDate`: AUM, position count, top-10 / top-25 concentration, QoQ turnover, latest / prior dates.
- `GetInstitutionSectorAllocation` — one filer's portfolio grouped by industry / sector for its latest 13F report; stocks lacking a classification collapse into an "Unclassified" row.
- `GetInstitutionQuarterlyActivity` — one filer's position changes vs. the prior quarter, bucketed into Initiated / Increased / Reduced / Exited; optional `bucket` filter to a single bucket.
- `CompareInstitutionPortfolios` — 13F portfolio overlap between two filers at their latest common `ReportDate`: Jaccard similarity, dollar-weighted overlap, and a side-by-side stock table with per-fund shares + percent of portfolio.
- `GetInstitutionConsensusHoldings` — combined portfolio of 2-25 filers at their latest common `ReportDate`; stocks ranked by holder count then combined value, with optional `minInstitutions` floor.
- `GetMostHeldStocks` — cross-sectional ranking of stocks by institutional 13F breadth for a quarter, ordered by filer count (default), quarter-over-quarter change in filer count (warming / cooling), or total reported value; includes Δ filers, total value, Δ value, and the stock's share of the 13F universe.
- `GetInstitutionCloneBacktest` — backtest cloning a filer's reported 13F portfolio against a benchmark over a trailing window, rebalancing on the SEC filing lag; uses raw closing prices for each exact listing, excludes dividends, and returns price return, price CAGR, max drawdown, and price-return alpha. Returns are unavailable when a held security or benchmark crosses a captured split without a certified price basis; the requested window is not shortened to hide it.

### `mcp.AddInsiderTrading()` — Forms 3 / 4 / 5

`InsiderTradingTools`:

- `GetInsiderTransactions` — recent transactions for a ticker, filterable by transaction code.
- `GetInsiderOwnership` — current insider ownership summary for a ticker.
- `SearchInsiders` — punctuation-independent all-whole-word search of SEC-filed owner names with a sparse any-word fallback, plus verified public-name aliases such as Jensen Huang → filed `HUANG JEN HSUN`.
- `GetForm144ProposedSales` — recent proposed insider sales for a ticker from SEC Form 144 notices: seller, relationship to the company, shares and aggregate market value to be sold, percent of shares outstanding, approximate sale date, broker, and filer remarks such as a stated 10b5-1 plan.

### `mcp.AddSec()` — SEC filings

`DocumentTextTools`:

- `ReadDocumentLines` — read a slice of a normalized SEC document by line range.

`RagSearchTools` (BM25 lexical ranking is always available; embeddings add semantic ranking; exact mode does literal matching):

- `SearchDocuments` — hybrid BM25 and semantic search across indexed SEC documents, optionally scoped by `ticker`; without embeddings it retains ranked BM25 results.
- `SearchDocument` — semantic or exact literal search inside a specific document.
- `ListFilings` — list stored filings newest first, market-wide or for one company, with date, document-type, and exact 8-K item-number filters.

`FailToDeliverTools`:

- `GetFailsToDeliver` — FTD records for a ticker over a date range.

`FormDTools`:

- `GetFormDOfferings` — recent exempt offerings (Regulation D private placements) for a company from SEC Form D notices: offering amount, amount sold (dollar figure or `Indefinite`), minimum investment, investor count, claimed exemptions, and amendment flag.

`NportTools`:

- `GetFundsHoldingStock` — reverse lookup: the registered funds and ETFs holding a given stock, matched by CUSIP against each fund series' most recent NPORT-P report (so an exited position never shows as current). Returns registrant and series, reporting period, position size, USD value, share of the fund's net assets, and payoff profile (Long/Short), largest positions first.

`FundDirectoryTools`:

- `SearchFunds` — punctuation-independent all-token search of the tracked registered-fund directory by series, ticker, or registrant, with a sparse any-token fallback; verified share-class aliases such as VOO/VFIAX resolve their SEC series. Returns profile id, net assets, stored holding count, full reported count when available, and latest report date, largest first; only multi-series trust rows limit the stored count to tracked-stock positions. An empty result is a coverage result: NPORT-P covers registered management investment companies and ETFs organized as unit investment trusts, money market funds and small business investment companies do not file it, and fixed-income-only trust series can be absent because directory entry requires a tracked-stock match.
- `GetFundProfile` — one registered fund's profile and largest stored holdings from its latest NPORT-P report, addressed by the same exact identifiers and verified aliases as `SearchFunds`; reports the full filed count beside the stored count.

`NCenTools`:

- `GetFundNcenReports` — operational data for a fund, ETF or closed-end fund from SEC Form N-CEN annual reports: registrant classification, Investment Company Act file number, reporting period, first/last-filing flags, the latest filing's named service providers, and an exact filed-name provider timeline. Uses the same exact fund identifiers and verified aliases as the directory. N-CEN is registrant-level and currently ingested through tracked issuer feeds, so a series in an untracked multi-series trust can resolve but still have no N-CEN report on record.

`InvestmentAdviserTools`:

- `SearchInvestmentAdvisers` — punctuation-independent all-token search of tracked SEC Form ADV legal/business names with a sparse any-token fallback; returns CRD, main office, regulatory AUM, and employee count, largest by assets first.
- `GetInvestmentAdviser` — full Form ADV profile for one adviser by Organization CRD number: legal and business names, SEC file number, main office, website, regulatory AUM (discretionary, non-discretionary, total), employee count, and fee structure.

### `mcp.AddFinancialFacts()` — XBRL facts

`FinancialFactsTools`:

- `GetFinancialFact` — time series for one XBRL concept (e.g. `us-gaap:Revenues`) on one ticker, with the exact period start/end and a coverage warning when the alias materially trails the company's other structured facts.
- `CompareFinancialFact` — same concept compared across multiple tickers.

`FinancialStatementTools`:

- `GetFinancialStatement` — full income statement / balance sheet / cash flow for a ticker + fiscal period, anchored to one actual period end. Quarterly USD flows are discrete quarters; a missing quarter is derived only by exact subtraction of compatible cumulative facts and marked in the `Basis` column.

`RevenueBreakdownTools`:

- `GetRevenueBreakdown` — revenue disaggregated by business segment, geography, and product/service from the dimensional XBRL facts the issuer tags in its own filings, plus reported segment operating income and a mechanically derived same-folded-member/exact-period operating-margin table: annual fiscal years only, latest restated source values, one table per axis the company reports; missing cells are never estimated.

### `mcp.AddCongress()` — congressional trading

`CongressTools`:

- `GetCongressionalTrades` — disclosed securities transactions for a ticker across all members; the Asset column identifies stock, option, bond, or another filed instrument.
- `GetMemberTrades` — disclosed securities transactions by one member of Congress, including the filed Asset instrument.
- `SearchCongressMembers` — punctuation-independent all-token roster search with a sparse any-token fallback, plus verified public-name aliases such as Dan Crenshaw → filed Daniel Crenshaw; optional chamber filter.
- `GetMemberNetWorth` — a member's net-worth history from annual financial disclosures, reported as yearly min–max bands (electronic filings only).

### `mcp.AddFred()` — FRED economic indicators

`FredTools`:

- `GetEconomicIndicator` — observations for a FRED series (e.g. `DGS10`, `UNRATE`), with units, frequency, and seasonal-adjustment metadata.
- `GetLatestEconomicIndicators` — latest snapshot across the curated macro indicators.
- `SearchEconomicIndicators` — punctuation-independent all-token search across tracked series IDs, titles, and categories with a sparse any-token fallback, plus standard aliases such as fed funds rate, jobless claims, payrolls, yield curve, and core CPI. Each result includes seasonal adjustment, latest observation date, and exact UTC series-sync time; an empty result says only that the curated tracked set has no match.
- `GetEconomicCalendar` — scheduled and recent US macro release dates (CPI, Employment Situation, GDP, …) and the FRED series each updates; defaults to the next 30 days.

### `mcp.AddStockPrices()` — Yahoo OHLCV + technical indicators

`StockPriceTools`:

Price functions resolve the exact authoritative listed symbol. Primary and secondary U.S.
exchange listings keep independent series, so `GOOG` never substitutes `GOOGL` and `BRK-A`
never substitutes `BRK-B`; dot share-class spelling such as `BRK.A` resolves to `BRK-A`.

- `GetStockPrices` — daily OHLCV + `AdjustedClose` for a ticker over a date range.
- `GetLatestClosingPrices` — latest close for one or more tickers.
- `GetDividendHistory` — declared cash-dividend history by ex-date for a company's current primary ticker.
- `GetStochasticOscillator` — Stochastic Oscillator (%K and %D) for a ticker over a date range.
- `GetAverageTrueRange` — Wilder's Average True Range (ATR) volatility measure for a ticker over a date range.
- `GetOnBalanceVolume` — On-Balance Volume (OBV) cumulative-flow indicator for a ticker over a date range.
- `GetBollingerBands` — Bollinger Bands for a ticker over a date range: a middle SMA of close with upper and lower bands set a number of standard deviations above and below it; bands widen as volatility rises.

### `mcp.AddShortData()` — FINRA + SEC FTD

`ShortDataTools`:

- `GetShortVolume` — daily short-volume time series (FINRA).
- `GetShortInterest` — bi-monthly short-interest reports for a ticker.
- `GetShortInterestSnapshot` — latest short-interest snapshot across tickers.
- `GetLargestShortVolume` — stocks with the largest daily short volume for a single trading day (defaults to the latest available), sorted by short volume descending.
- `GetShortSqueezeScores` — stocks ranked by a composite short-squeeze score (0–100, highest first): the equal-weight mean of peer-relative percentiles for short interest as a percent of shares outstanding, days to cover, and the recent change in the short share of total volume, computed across every stock reporting short interest at the latest FINRA settlement date (`ShortSqueezeScoreManager.Compute`).

`OffExchangeVolumeTools`:

- `GetOffExchangeVolume` — weekly off-exchange (dark-pool / OTC) volume per ticker from FINRA OTC/ATS Transparency data: ATS volume and trade count, non-ATS OTC volume and trade count, and the ATS + non-ATS OTC total. Responses containing a week before 2025-08-11 warn that the historical row may include volume from a case-variant sibling security that can no longer be re-imported.

### `mcp.AddCftc()` — CFTC Commitments of Traders

`CftcTools`:

- `GetCftcPositioning` — non-commercial / commercial / non-reportable positions over time for a contract.
- `GetLatestCftcPositioning` — latest weekly snapshot across all tracked contracts.
- `SearchCftcMarkets` — token-AND search of the curated CFTC contract set by name/code, plus common contract names and standard futures symbols such as WTI/CL and ES.

### `mcp.AddCboe()` — CBOE indicators

`CboeTools`:

- `GetPutCallRatios` — put/call ratios by category (equity, index, total, VIX, ETP).
- `GetVixHistory` — daily VIX OHLC history (1990-present once backfilled).

### `mcp.AddGovernmentContracts()` — federal contract awards

`GovernmentContractsTools`:

- `GetGovernmentContracts` — federal contract awards (USAspending.gov) won by one public company, with the government-named recipient, awarding agency, total value, outlays when reported, period dates, and description.
- `GetTopGovernmentContractors` — rank public companies by total federal contract dollars awarded over a date range.

### `mcp.AddFdaCatalysts()` — FDA advisory-committee meetings

`FdaCatalystTools`:

- `GetFdaAdvisoryCommitteeMeetings` — scheduled FDA advisory-committee (AdComm) meetings from the FDA.gov calendar — the regulatory catalyst dates that move biotech and pharma stocks.

## Tool implementation conventions

- Every tool method runs through [`McpToolExecutor.Execute`](../../src/Equibles.Mcp/McpToolExecutor.cs), which wraps the body in a try/catch and logs failures.
- Failures are reported via the injected `ErrorManager` so they show on the Status dashboard.
- On failure, `McpToolExecutor.Execute` returns a safe `"An error occurred while executing <ToolName>..."` string instead of throwing across the MCP boundary.
- Tool classes carry `[McpServerToolType]`; tool methods carry `[McpServerTool(Name = "...")]` + a `[Description]` so the MCP client gets a usable schema.
- Tools return Markdown-formatted strings (tables for tabular data, headings for grouped output). The MCP transport ferries strings; no binary payloads.
- Tools call repositories directly for reads. Writes are not exposed through MCP — the surface is intentionally read-only.
- Date parameters accept `YYYY-MM-DD`; `null` / missing defaults to "latest available" (each tool documents its own default in its `[Description]`).

## Auth

- `IApiKeyValidator` ([`Equibles.Mcp.Contracts.IApiKeyValidator`](../../src/Equibles.Mcp/Contracts)) controls whether the API-key check is enforced.
- The MCP host registers [`SimpleApiKeyValidator`](../../src/Equibles.Mcp.Server/SimpleApiKeyValidator.cs), which reads `McpApiKey` from configuration.
- When `McpApiKey` is empty or unset, `IsEnabled = false` and `ApiKeyMiddleware` lets every request through.
- When enabled, requests must include `Authorization: Bearer <key>`. Malformed or missing headers get a 401 with a JSON body — never an unprocessed pass-through.
- Custom validators can replace `SimpleApiKeyValidator` by registering a different `IApiKeyValidator` implementation in the host's `ConfigureServices`.

## Adding a new MCP tool

- Add the method to the existing `*Tools` class for that module (single tool class per module is the established pattern; only split when the surface grows past ~5 methods).
- Apply `[McpServerTool(Name = "ToolName")]` + `[Description("…")]` on the method, `[Description("…")]` on every parameter.
- Wrap the body in `McpToolExecutor.Execute(...)` so failures are logged + surfaced via `ErrorManager` instead of crashing the MCP request.
- Return Markdown; prefer ≤8 columns for chat readability, but retain required attribution or evidence fields when parity needs a wider table.
- No host change required — `AssemblyMcpModule<TMarker>` discovers the new method via `WithToolsFromAssembly` on the next startup.
