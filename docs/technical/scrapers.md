# Scrapers and Integrations

## European annual report history

- ESEF capture matches source LEIs to verified issuers without a SEC CIK.
- Future reporting periods in index metadata are rejected before selection; completed reports must not be masked by an erroneous future date.
- A reporting period later than the index's stated receipt date remains invalid even after that period becomes historical.
- Future receipt dates are excluded before selection and cannot become stored filing dates.
- Select one report per source-stated annual period, newest first, using the existing deterministic country and validation ordering.
- Capture at most one missing period per issuer per cycle; issuers missing their latest report take priority over historical backfill.
- Stored reports and terminal size refusals do not block earlier periods or consume download budget.
- An HTML size refusal makes the index's exact `json_url` eligible on the next cycle; the refused HTML is not downloaded again.
- Both representations retain the 50 MiB ceiling and shared host pacing; a JSON size refusal closes that filing until its representation or ceiling changes.
- Preserve the HTML URL and ceiling independently when recording a JSON refusal; a changed JSON URL must not redownload unchanged oversized HTML.
- Require conflict-free facts at the indexed period and reject later supported issuer periods; a comparative alone cannot validate a misaddressed report.
- JSON capture retains the original bytes and source URL, with no invented retrieval text; unsupported or mismatched issuer/period evidence stays retryable.
- Structured recovery publishes only unqualified standard IFRS facts with an exact ISO 17442 issuer identity; dimensional, custom, unsupported numeric and timezone-bearing period shapes remain unavailable.
- xBRL-JSON values are already scaled; `decimals` describes precision, and midnight instant/end timestamps map to the preceding inclusive calendar date.
- Recovery is recurring reconciliation, not a one-time script; no extraction-version bump replays already captured HTML documents.
- Initialize missing fiscal-calendar metadata from the latest indexed annual period, never from an older backfill report.
- Historical ingestion is recurring reconciliation: subsequent cycles discover missing periods, and a fully captured issuer makes no report requests.
- Capturing an XBRL envelope queues existing financial-fact extraction; capture counts alone do not prove published financial coverage.

How the `*.HostedService` workers ingest data, how the `Equibles.Integrations.*` HTTP clients talk to upstream APIs, and how the deduplication ledgers keep re-runs idempotent.

## Two-layer shape

- **HostedService** — orchestration. Inherits `BaseScraperWorker`, decides what to fetch and when, persists rows through repositories / managers.
- **Integrations** — outbound HTTP. Plain client classes (`SecEdgarClient`, `FredClient`, `YahooFinanceClient`, …) that know nothing about EF, repositories, or workers — pure protocol code.

The split keeps the database concerns and the protocol concerns testable in isolation. An integration client returns DTOs; the HostedService maps DTOs onto entities.

## Worker base — [`BaseScraperWorker`](../../src/Equibles.Worker/BaseScraperWorker.cs)

Abstract `BackgroundService` that every scraper extends. Subclass surface:

| Member | Role |
|---|---|
| `WorkerName` | Log prefix + error-source label. |
| `SleepInterval` | Time between successful cycles (typically 24h). |
| `ErrorSource` | The `ErrorSource` smart-enum used when reporting failures. |
| `DoWork(stoppingToken)` | The actual work for one cycle. |
| `ValidateConfiguration()` | Optional gate; return `false` to short-circuit the loop on missing config. |

Built-in behavior:

- One try/catch per cycle. Unhandled exceptions go through `ErrorReporter.Report(ErrorSource, "<Worker>.DoWork", ...)` and the loop sleeps to the next cycle instead of crashing the host.
- `OperationCanceledException` during shutdown logs and exits cleanly — never reported as an error.
- `RequestRetrySoon()` — sets a flag mid-cycle that swaps the next wait from `SleepInterval` to `NotReadyRetryInterval` (default 2 minutes).
- Used when a dependency isn't ready yet (e.g. cold-start race where `CommonStock` hasn't been seeded).
- The flag resets at the start of every cycle.

Subclass-specific extras (worth knowing because they show up in multiple workers):

- `WaitForNextCycle(interval, stoppingToken)` — override hook to interrupt the sleep on an external signal.
- [`HoldingsScraperWorker`](../../src/Equibles.Holdings.HostedService/HoldingsScraperWorker.cs) uses `WaitForNextCycle` to wake immediately when `HoldingsRescanSignal` fires after a `StockCusipChanged` event.
- Per-attempt retry delays exposed as `protected virtual` properties (e.g. `RetryDelays = [30s, 2m, 10m]`) so tests can collapse them without changing production.

## Integration clients — [`Equibles.Integrations.*`](../../src/Equibles.Integrations.Common)

Each upstream source has its own integration project:

| Project | Upstream |
|---|---|
| `Equibles.Integrations.Sec` | SEC EDGAR (filings, FTD, submissions JSON, XBRL companyfacts) |
| `Equibles.Integrations.Fred` | Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis FRED |
| `Equibles.Integrations.Yahoo` | Yahoo Finance (`query1.finance.yahoo.com`) |
| `Equibles.Integrations.Finra` | FINRA API |
| `Equibles.Integrations.Cftc` | CFTC Commitments of Traders |
| `Equibles.Integrations.Cboe` | CBOE indicators |
| `Equibles.Integrations.GovernmentContracts` | USAspending.gov federal contract awards |
| `Equibles.Integrations.Wikidata` | Wikidata SPARQL endpoint (company metadata discovery) |
| `Equibles.Integrations.Common` | Shared infrastructure — `RateLimiter` plus the `RetryBackoff` exponential-backoff formula and the `HttpRetry.Send` 429/5xx retry helper |

Every client follows the same shape: one interface + one implementation registered via `[Service(ServiceLifetime.Scoped, typeof(IXxxClient))]` (the AutoWire attribute from `Equibles.Core.AutoWiring`). The interface lives in `Contracts/`, the DTOs in `Models/`, and the wire/transport details in the client class itself.

### Rate limiting — [`RateLimiter`](../../src/Equibles.Integrations.Common/RateLimiter)

- `IRateLimiter` exposes `WaitAsync()` + `PauseFor(TimeSpan)`.
- Each client owns a `static readonly IRateLimiter` configured for its upstream's published (or reverse-engineered) limit — e.g. Yahoo uses `40 requests / minute`.
- `WaitAsync()` blocks until the sliding-window counter allows another request; calls itself recursively after the delay so a long pause never silently lets a request through.
- `PauseFor(TimeSpan)` extends the no-go window — used when the upstream returns `429` to widen the cooldown beyond what the steady-state counter would impose.
- The pause is monotonic: a later, shorter pause never shortens an already-set later deadline.

### Retry pattern

Two retry shapes appear across the clients; pick by upstream behaviour:

- **Bounded exponential backoff** (FRED, Yahoo, CBOE) — `for attempt in 0..MaxRetries`, sleep `2^attempt` seconds on `429` / `5xx` / network failure.
- After the last attempt, give up with `HttpRequestException("Max retries exceeded …")`.
- **Auth-refresh + retry** (FINRA, Yahoo session cookies) — on `401` / `403`, invalidate the cached token / cookie, refresh, retry once.
- Distinct from the rate-limit retry because the failure mode is "session expired" rather than "too fast".

Anything mid-cycle that the upstream guarantees is transient (e.g. a partial JSON response) is converted into a structured error and reported via `ErrorReporter`, not retried into oblivion.

## Bookkeeping

Workers that fetch from a paginated / batched feed maintain a dedup ledger so re-running the same cycle is idempotent.

### Holdings — `ProcessedDataSet` + `ProcessedFiling`

[`ProcessedDataSet`](../../src/Equibles.Holdings.Data/Models/ProcessedDataSet.cs):

- Keyed by SEC quarterly bulk-data-set file name (`form13fhr_2024q3_01.zip`).
- Marks a file as fully ingested so the next `HoldingsScraperWorker` cycle skips it.
- Stores a `SubmissionCount` for observability.
- Contains a sentinel row `BackfillGuardFileName = "__backfill-guard__"` — a name that never matches a real file.
- The sentinel keeps the table non-empty after `StockCusipChangedConsumer` clears real rows for a backfill, so `BackfillProcessedDataSets` doesn't re-seed history as "processed" before the backfill actually runs.

[`ProcessedFiling`](../../src/Equibles.Holdings.Data/Models/ProcessedFiling.cs):

- Keyed by accession number.
- Recorded by [`Holdings13FRealtimeWorker`](../../src/Equibles.Holdings.HostedService/Holdings13FRealtimeWorker.cs) for every individual 13F-HR submission already handed to the import pipeline.
- An amendment carries a new accession number, so it is still processed; a previously-handled original is never re-processed.
- Without this ledger, re-sweeping the daily index after an amendment's delete-by-period would upsert stale originals back over the amendment.
- Filings that produced zero tracked holdings are recorded too — otherwise the same empty filing would be re-downloaded every cycle.

### SEC — `Document` rows act as the ledger

Per-document `Equibles.Sec.Data.Models.Document` rows carry the accession + the processing status. `DocumentScraper` writes the row on first sight; `DocumentProcessorWorker` flips it to processed after the per-document-type processor (`InsiderTradingFilingProcessor`, etc.) returns successfully. A failure leaves the row in its current state so the next cycle retries.

### SEC Financial Facts — per-stock filing watermark + per-document version stamp

The two SEC Financial Facts workers each keep their own ledger.

- [`FinancialFactsScraperWorker`](../../src/Equibles.Sec.FinancialFacts.HostedService/FinancialFactsScraperWorker.cs) walks every CIK-bearing company and pulls its SEC Company Facts. [`FinancialFactsImportService`](../../src/Equibles.Sec.FinancialFacts.HostedService/Services/FinancialFactsImportService.cs) records a per-stock [`FinancialFactsSyncStatus`](../../src/Equibles.Sec.FinancialFacts.Data/Models/FinancialFactsSyncStatus.cs) row (keyed by `CommonStockId`) holding `LastFiledDateSeen` and `LastCheckedAt`.
- When the API's max `Filed` date is no newer than `LastFiledDateSeen`, the import skips the expensive full-history re-upsert and only refreshes the share count — so a re-run costs one Company Facts request per company, not a full reparse.
- `LastCheckedAt` also gates the walk itself: each cycle only visits companies never checked or checked before the `RecheckIntervalHours` window (default 20h; never-checked first, then stalest first). Because the sweep restarts on every host restart and each visit downloads the full Company Facts JSON before the watermark can say "nothing new", the window is what makes a restart resume the aborted sweep instead of re-downloading the whole universe.
- [`XbrlFactsExtractionWorker`](../../src/Equibles.Sec.FinancialFacts.HostedService/XbrlFactsExtractionWorker.cs) sweeps documents whose captured XBRL envelope has not been processed at the current `XbrlFactExtractionService.CurrentVersion`, stamped per document via `Document.XbrlFactsVersion` — see [Modules → SEC Financial Facts](modules.md) for the dimensional-facts detail.
- Foreign annual and interim reports also fill missing standard consolidated facts from captured XBRL. Recovery requires an unqualified matching SEC CIK context and the official financial taxonomy namespace; duplicate context IDs and conflicting values are refused. Inserts never update an existing Company Facts natural key. Version 6 replays foreign reports only; unchanged domestic version-5 captures do not repeat their parsing work.

### FTD / FINRA / FRED / Yahoo / CFTC / CBOE — "latest date" cursor

These sources publish a continuous time series rather than discrete filings. Each scraper resolves the start date via `SyncDateResolver.Resolve(latestInDb, workerOptions)`:

- If the database already has data → start from `latestInDb + 1 day`.
- Otherwise → `WorkerOptions.MinSyncDate` if set, else `2020-01-01`.

The cursor pattern means re-running is cheap (a single query for `max(date)` per cycle); duplicate ingestion is prevented by the per-source unique index (`[Index(nameof(CommonStockId), nameof(Date), IsUnique = true)]` etc.).

### FDA catalysts — watermark-less re-read + upsert

[`FdaCatalystScraperWorker`](../../src/Equibles.FdaCatalysts.HostedService/FdaCatalystScraperWorker.cs) reconciles the forward-looking FDA advisory-committee calendar, which carries no historical watermark — every cycle re-reads the whole calendar rather than resuming from a `max(date)` cursor.

- [`FdaAdvisoryCommitteeCalendarImportService`](../../src/Equibles.FdaCatalysts.HostedService/Services/FdaAdvisoryCommitteeCalendarImportService.cs) parses the calendar, then upserts each meeting by its stable per-meeting slug (`FdaCatalyst.SourceReference`): an existing row refreshes its mutable fields, a new meeting inserts.
- The calendar is mutable — scheduled dates and venues shift before a meeting happens — so a `max(date)` cursor would skip edits to already-stored meetings. Re-reading every cycle keeps stored rows in sync.

### Government contracts — windowed scan with unique-key dedup

[`GovernmentContractsImportService`](../../src/Equibles.GovernmentContracts.HostedService/Services/GovernmentContractsImportService.cs) resumes from a `SyncDateResolver` watermark like the cursor scrapers above (`max(ActionDate)`), but USAspending requires a bounded date range per request, so it walks forward from that start date in `WindowDays`-sized chunks.

- Awards back-fill into past dates, so a monotonic cursor alone would re-import already-stored rows. Each window's mapped awards are de-duplicated against `LoadExistingKeys` by `AwardUniqueKey` before persistence — only genuinely new awards insert.
- A transient transport failure aborts the scan and records one error; the next run resumes from the same watermark. Window-specific failures fall through so the remaining windows still process.

### Congress — fixed-window re-scan across both chambers

The two congressional scrapers re-read a fixed recent window every cycle instead of advancing a `max(date)` watermark, because members file and amend disclosures well after the reporting period — a monotonic cursor would step past a late filing and never pick it up.

- [`CongressionalTradeSyncService`](../../src/Equibles.Congress.HostedService/Services/CongressionalTradeSyncService.cs) re-reads trades from `MinSyncDate` (default: January 1 of the current year) to today from both the `SenateDisclosureClient` and `HouseDisclosureClient`, then matches each transaction to a tracked stock.
- One older chamber/year partition is replayed per cycle, newest missing year first down to the STOCK Act start in 2012. `CongressionalTradeImportPartition` is written only after the source index and every recordable filing complete, and stores the parser version so a later parser can reopen every year. Unavailable or malformed archives retry instead of becoming false empty years.
- `CongressionalFilingRecord.ParserVersion` replays filings after parser changes. The trade parser retains the filed instrument type and account/subholding, and treats a lone standard range floor as that disclosure bracket rather than as a zero-based band.
- [`CongressionalAnnualDisclosureSyncService`](../../src/Equibles.Congress.HostedService/Services/CongressionalAnnualDisclosureSyncService.cs) re-reads annual financial disclosures across a span of coverage years (House per year, Senate by submitted date) and upserts each report by its stable key, so a late amendment refreshes the stored row rather than inserting a duplicate.

## Cold-start patterns

- Empty `CommonStock` table → most scrapers `RequestRetrySoon()` and wait `NotReadyRetryInterval` (2 min) instead of the full `SleepInterval` (24h).
- The pattern handles the first ~30 min after a fresh deploy while `CompanySyncService` is still populating the universe.
- Realtime workers depend on the bulk-data backfill having seeded history; until then they still run but produce no rows.
- Once `BackfillProcessedDataSets` has run, the realtime path takes over.

## Error reporting

- Every worker has an `ErrorReporter` injected and a fixed `ErrorSource` (the smart-enum value).
- Unexpected exceptions surface as rows in the `Error` table via `ErrorReporter.Report(source, location, message, stackTrace)`.
- The Web portal's Status page reads from the same table — a failing scraper shows up there within seconds of `ErrorReporter.Report` returning, even if the worker keeps running.
- Reporting itself never throws into the worker — `Report` swallows its own failures and logs them so a sick `Error` table doesn't take down a healthy scraper.

## Rescan signals

In-process pub/sub between modules:

- [`HoldingsRescanSignal`](../../src/Equibles.Holdings.HostedService/HoldingsRescanSignal.cs) — singleton wrapping a `SemaphoreSlim(0, 1)`; repeated requests coalesce to a single pending rescan.
- `StockCusipChangedConsumer` (MassTransit) calls `HoldingsRescanSignal.RequestRescan()` after invalidating processed data.
- `HoldingsScraperWorker.WaitForNextCycle` races the signal against its 24h timer and wakes on whichever fires first.
- Pattern is reusable. Add a singleton with the same async-signal shape (`WaitAsync` / `Signal`) when one module's events should wake another module's worker.

## Adding a new scraper

1. Add a new project `src/Equibles.<Module>.HostedService` referencing `Equibles.Worker`, the module's `.Data` and `.Repositories` projects, and the matching `Equibles.Integrations.<Source>`.
2. Worker class inherits `BaseScraperWorker`. Set `WorkerName`, `SleepInterval`, `ErrorSource`; implement `DoWork`.
3. Register the worker with `services.AddHostedService<MyScraperWorker>()` from a `ServiceCollectionExtensions.Add<Module>Worker(this IServiceCollection)` method.
4. Add `builder.Services.Add<Module>Worker()` to [`Equibles.Worker.Host/Program.cs`](../../src/Equibles.Worker.Host/Program.cs).
5. If the scraper has tunables, define `<Module>ScraperOptions`, bind it in the host with `services.Configure<...>(builder.Configuration.GetSection("<Module>Scraper"))`, and inject `IOptions<...>` into the worker.
6. If the source is paginated → write a `Processed<X>` ledger table. If it's a continuous time series → use `SyncDateResolver.Resolve` against `max(date)`.
