        // split on 2026-04-06; the split-price reconciliation then rewrote the stock's whole
        // stored price history onto the post-split basis, so the 2024-06-30 close became $68.50
        // (fifty times the $1.37 the shares actually traded at). The filing was re-imported after
        // that, multiplying an as-filed count by a restated price, and the position was published
        // at $43,426,191 — fifty times its real size, and enough to make BioAtla ~48% of that
