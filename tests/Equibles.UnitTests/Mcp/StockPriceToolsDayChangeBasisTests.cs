// Pins the date guard on GetLatestClosingPrices' Change / Change % columns.
//
// The defect this defends against: the tool takes the two newest DailyStockPrice rows and
// differences them. The end-of-day lane crawls the whole common-stock universe and can finish
// a session or more behind, so the second-newest row is frequently NOT the previous trading
// session — and the difference is then a multi-session move presented as a one-day change.
// Measured in production: SWDR's two newest rows sat 25 sessions apart and the tool reported
// +11,630.77% as its day change.
//
// The guard is by DATE, not by row position or by a calendar-day tolerance. A tolerance cannot
// work: Mon 2026-07-27 vs Thu 2026-07-23 (Friday skipped, a real reported case) is four
// calendar days apart, and so is Mon 2026-07-06 vs Thu 2026-07-02, which IS adjacent because
// Jul 3 was an observed market close. Only the trading calendar separates those two.
