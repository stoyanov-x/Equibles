        // caught up) Import must short-circuit BEFORE hitting SEC EDGAR (no zip download) AND
        // before BuildTickerMap (no DB scan of CommonStock). Every existing test on this
        // service exercises the two static helpers (GetFileNames, IsRecentFtdFile); none
        // exercise the instance Import flow at all — so the entire early-exit branch
        // currently survives any regression silently.
        //
        // The risk this pins is the blast radius of an order-of-operations regression:
        //   • A refactor that swaps `var tickerMap = await BuildTickerMap(...)` and the
        //     `if (fileNames.Count == 0) return;` early-exit would compile cleanly, pass
        //     every static-method pin in this file and its UnitTests sibling, and silently
        //     start scanning every CommonStock row on every tick of a caught-up scraper —
        //     a wasted ToDictionaryAsync per tick across thousands of rows on a daily
        //     schedule.
        //   • Worse, a refactor that moves the SEC download out of the
        //     `foreach (var fileName in fileNames)` loop (or that doesn't guard against an
        //     empty fileNames list) would issue a request to sec.gov even when there's
        //     nothing to download. SEC EDGAR enforces a 10 req/s budget per User-Agent
        //     across the whole deployment and returns 429s when exceeded; burning that
        //     budget on a no-op is exactly the kind of "small per-tick, daily forever"
