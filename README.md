**Equibles is a self-hosted, open-source financial data MCP server** — an open-source alternative to a Bloomberg Terminal, built for AI agents rather than humans. It scrapes, stores, and serves SEC filings and XBRL financials, 13F institutional holdings, insider and congressional trades, FINRA/SEC short data, FRED economic indicators, CFTC and CBOE positioning, fund filings, government contracts, and daily stock prices — and exposes all of it over the Model Context Protocol, so Claude, ChatGPT, Cursor, or any agent can query it directly. Runs on your own hardware with Docker, for free, forever.

**This is the open-source core of [Equibles](https://equibles.com).** [Equibles Cloud](https://equibles.com/mcp) runs this exact core and adds more tools on top — earnings call transcripts and audio, real-time quotes, options chains with Greeks, LLM-extracted KPIs and guidance, buybacks, IPO filings, executive changes, valuation multiples, index composition, portfolio tracking, and a full US-market screener. Same protocol, same tool names, nothing to run — see [what's included](#whats-included).

## Why Some Data Is Cloud-Only

Nothing above is held back from this repo. The cloud-only rows are data whose *production* needs infrastructure you would not stand up at home:

- **Transcripts and audio** — earnings calls are webcasts, not filings. Each one has to be discovered and recorded by a browser fleet, then put through GPU speech-to-text with speaker diarization, every call, every quarter.
- **Live quotes and options chains** — licensed real-time feeds, plus an always-on streaming service to fan them out. Neither the licence nor the uptime fits in a container on a laptop.
- **KPIs, guidance, buybacks, IPO terms, executives, risk flags** — pulled out of filings, proxies, and earnings releases by LLM extraction lanes with verification passes and a human review queue, which needs sustained inference capacity.
- **Investor-relations events and news** — collected from thousands of company IR sites, needing the same stealth browser fleet as the webcasts.
- **Multiples, screener, smart money, market context** — derived, and only meaningful over a fully backfilled corpus of the whole market rather than the tickers you happen to have scraped so far.
- **Index composition** — assembled from every tracking fund's N-PORT schedule plus each fund's own holdings file fetched daily, which needs the full NPORT corpus and a fetcher that keeps re-learning where those files moved to.
- **Portfolios** — not scraped data at all: it is your own, stored against your account. The self-hosted build has no accounts, so there is nothing to store it against.

Beyond the data, the cloud is already backfilled and kept current, and it is managed — no scrapers to babysit. This repo is free forever under AGPL-3.0; the cloud has a free tier at 100 requests/day with no card.

Start on [the free tier](https://equibles.com/mcp), and self-host whenever you'd rather own the stack.

## Quick Start

### Docker Compose (recommended)

The fastest way to get everything running. Requires Docker.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/daniel3303/Equibles.git
cd Equibles
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env and set SEC_CONTACT_EMAIL (required by SEC EDGAR fair access policy)
docker compose up
```

This starts:

| Service | Port | Description |
|---------|------|-------------|
| **db** | 5432 | ParadeDB (PostgreSQL + pgvector + pg_search) |
| **web** | 8080 | Web portal for browsing data |
| **mcp** | 8081 | MCP server for AI assistants |
| **worker** | — | Scrapers (SEC, FINRA, Congress, FRED, Yahoo, CFTC, CBOE, USAspending, FDA, FIRDS, European exchange directories) |

Data scraping starts automatically. SEC filings, holdings, insider trades, and congressional trades will begin populating within minutes.

## Configuration

All settings can be configured via a `.env` file in the project root (recommended for Docker) or environment variables.

**FINRA Short Data (free API key required):**

The FINRA scraper (short volume and short interest) requires a free API key. Without it, the scraper skips gracefully and all other scrapers run normally. Fails-to-deliver data comes from SEC and works without FINRA credentials.

To get a key:

1. Go to the [FINRA API Console](https://gateway.finra.org/app/api-console) and sign in (a Google account works)
2. Open the **API Credentials** menu and create a new **API Key**
3. Copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret**
4. Set `Finra__ClientId` and `Finra__ClientSecret` in your `.env` file or environment variables

> The older `developer.finra.org` "Teams & Apps" flow has been retired — use the API Console above.

**FRED Economic Data (free API key required):**

The FRED scraper requires a free API key from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. Without it, the scraper skips gracefully and all other scrapers run normally.

To get a key:

1. Register at [fred.stlouisfed.org/docs/api/api_key.html](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/docs/api/api_key.html)
2. Copy the 32-character API key
3. Set `Fred__ApiKey` in your `.env` file or environment variables

**Ticker Filtering (optional):**

By default, all tickers are synced. To limit data syncing to specific stocks, set a single ticker list that applies to all scrapers:

```env
# .env — sync only these tickers (applies to all scrapers)
Worker__TickersToSync__0=AAPL
Worker__TickersToSync__1=MSFT
Worker__TickersToSync__2=GOOGL
```

When not set, all stocks are synced.

**Minimum Sync Date (optional):**

By default, all scrapers start from January 2020. Set a more recent date for faster initial sync, or go as far back as 2000-01-01 for more historical data:

```env
# .env — start syncing from 2024 instead of 2020
Worker__MinSyncDate=2024-01-01
```

**Embedding (opt-in):**

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `Embedding__Enabled` | `false` | Set to `true` to enable vector embedding generation |
| `Embedding__Provider` | `Ollama` | `Ollama` (`/api/embed`) or `OpenAI` (`/v1/embeddings` — vLLM, Text-Embeddings-Inference, or OpenAI) |
| `Embedding__BaseUrl` | — | Embedding endpoint (e.g., `http://localhost:11434`) |
| `Embedding__ModelName` | — | Model name (e.g., `qwen3-embedding:0.6b`) |
| `Embedding__ApiKey` | — | Bearer token, if the server requires one (e.g. vLLM `--api-key`) |
| `Embedding__BatchSize` | `10` | Texts per embedding batch |

**Update notifications (optional):**

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `CHECK_FOR_UPDATES` | `true` | When `true`, the web portal checks GitHub Releases and shows a banner when a newer version is available. Set to `false` to disable. |

**Authentication (optional):**

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `AUTH_USERNAME` | — | Web portal username (auth disabled if empty) |
| `AUTH_PASSWORD` | — | Web portal password (auth disabled if empty) |
| `MCP_API_KEY` | — | MCP server API key (auth disabled if empty) |

When set, the web portal requires login and the MCP server requires `Authorization: Bearer <key>` header. When unset, everything is open access (default).

## Updating

The web portal checks GitHub Releases on a schedule and shows a banner when a newer version is available (disable with `CHECK_FOR_UPDATES=false`). To update to the latest release:

**Docker Compose:**

```bash
git pull
docker compose up -d --build --remove-orphans
```

Include any optional Compose override files in the upgrade command so those services remain enabled.

**From source:**

```bash
git pull
dotnet build Equibles.sln
```

Database migrations are applied automatically on startup. Review the [changelog](CHANGELOG.md) for notable changes before upgrading.

## Web Portal

The web portal at `http://localhost:8080` provides a browser-based interface for exploring data:

- **Stocks** — Browse and search all tracked companies, view price charts with technical indicators (SMA, EMA, RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands), golden/death-cross and price-streak badges, performance versus SPY, plus per-stock tabs for institutional holdings, short data, SEC filings, financial statements, insider trading, proposed (Form 144) sales, fund holdings (NPORT), fund operations (N-CEN), exempt offerings (Form D), and congressional trades
- **Institutions** — Browse institutional holders (hedge funds, asset managers), view detailed profiles with portfolio breakdowns, industry allocation, quarterly activity, backtesting, and side-by-side comparisons. Filers are scored on risk-adjusted performance (alpha vs. a benchmark) and a Smart Money Index page aggregates the highest-scoring funds into a consensus signal. Includes a holdings screener with filters (filer count, value, float %, location, AUM/position-count, industry) and CSV export
- **Advisers** — Browse SEC-registered investment advisers (`/advisers`), ranked by assets under management, with per-firm profiles (regulatory AUM, main office, employee count, fee structure)
- **Insider Trading** — Dashboard showing the top insider buys, sells, and biggest transactions over the last 90 days
- **Short Activity** — Most-shorted leaderboard (`/most-shorted`, ranked by FINRA short interest) and largest daily short volume (`/short-volume`), each with a date selector, server-side sort, and pagination
- **Economy** — Browse FRED economic indicators grouped by category (interest rates, inflation, employment, GDP, etc.) with charts and statistics
- **Futures** — CFTC Commitments of Traders positioning data for 30+ futures contracts (commodities, indices, currencies) with commercial/non-commercial position charts
- **Market** — CBOE market indicators: VIX volatility index with OHLC charts, put/call ratios (equity, index, total, VIX, ETP)
- **Search** — Global search across stocks, institutions, insiders, and congress members with category filtering and date ranges
- **Status** — System health, worker status, data counts, and error log

## MCP Server

- **FDA Catalysts** — Scheduled FDA advisory-committee (AdComm) meetings over a date range — the regulatory catalyst dates that move biotech and pharma stocks (FDA.gov)

### Output Format (GCF, opt-in)

By default the table tools return markdown tables. [Graph Compact Format](https://gcformat.com)
is used instead when it is smaller, otherwise it falls back to markdown. GCF carries the same
cells the markdown table would show, with the column names factored into a single header and
the per-cell `| ` padding and separator row dropped.

It reaches the answers rendered through `MarkdownTable.Render`, which today is the short-volume
and short-interest tools, off-exchange volume, fails-to-deliver, congressional trades and member
disclosures, the FRED series and calendar tools, CFTC positioning, CBOE ratios, FDA advisory
meetings, government contracts, and the institution and adviser search tools. Tools that assemble
their answer with `MarkdownTable.Start` and append rows themselves are **not** encoded, because
those answers continue past the table with truncation notes and footnotes; that includes the
price, financial-statement, insider, dividend, 13F-portfolio, fund-filing and filing-search
tools. Routing them through the shared renderer is tracked separately.

Ask for it **per request**, which is what a shared server wants, with either the
`X-Equibles-Output-Format: gcf` header or an `?output_format=gcf` query parameter (the query
parameter is there for clients whose only configuration is a URL). `markdown` is accepted the
same way, so a caller can opt out of a server that defaults to GCF. An unrecognized value is
ignored rather than refused, and the server's own default applies.

Set `EQUIBLES_OUTPUT_FORMAT=gcf` to make GCF the **process-wide** default instead. A request
that names a format wins over it; one that names nothing gets it.

Per-request selection relies on each tool call arriving as its own HTTP request, which is how
the streamable HTTP transport works in both its stateless and session modes: the format is read
off that request and applies to it alone. A transport that instead dispatched calls on a
connection opened earlier would carry whatever the opening request asked for.

How much it saves depends on the shape of the answer. The table compresses, the prose around
it does not, so a small table inside a long preamble saves least and a wide table of many
short values saves most. Measured end to end against a deployed server on real answers from
three of the covered tools, 30 sessions of daily short volume, 25 congressional trades and 24
monthly observations of a FRED series, the answer text is **7 to 13% shorter** in characters.

That is the text your client hands the model, not the HTTP payload. JSON escapes every
quotation mark the encoder adds, so the transport bytes can grow on the same answer whose text
shrank.

It is deliberately conservative: **every cell value is preserved verbatim** (the compact-USD,
comma-grouped, adaptive-decimal and em-dash formatting is untouched — GCF only changes the
framing, not the numbers a model reads), and any row that does not match the header's column
shape falls back to the markdown table, so a result is never dropped or garbled. Output is
unchanged for a caller that asks for nothing on a server that sets nothing. GCF is
MIT-licensed and its encoder is
zero-dependency.

## Vector Embeddings (advanced, opt-in)

Vector embeddings enable semantic search over SEC filings (e.g., "find revenue growth discussion in Apple's 10-K"). This requires downloading the Ollama runtime (~2GB) and the Qwen3-Embedding-0.6B model (~640MB).

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.embedding.yml up
```

This adds Ollama and configures the existing web, MCP, and worker services to use it:

| Service | Port | Description |
|---------|------|-------------|
| **embedding** | 11434 | Ollama server with Qwen3-Embedding-0.6B model |
| **embedding-pull** | — | One-shot model download before the worker starts |
| **worker** | — | The existing worker, with embedding generation enabled |

Without the embedding override, BM25 full-text search via ParadeDB still works out of the box — vector search is purely additive.

**Bundled Ollama is the default** because it needs no GPU and runs anywhere. For bulk embedding at scale, point `Embedding__Provider=OpenAI` at a batched server such as [vLLM](https://docs.vllm.ai) or [Text-Embeddings-Inference](https://github.com/huggingface/text-embeddings-inference) — they continuously batch on the GPU and are far faster than Ollama for large corpora. See [docs/guide/how-to-use-external-embedding-endpoint.md](docs/guide/how-to-use-external-embedding-endpoint.md).
