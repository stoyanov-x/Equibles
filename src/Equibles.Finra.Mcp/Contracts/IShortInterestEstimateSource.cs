/// disseminates each file five business days after the filing deadline, so the newest reported
/// row a caller can read is routinely two to three weeks stale — long enough for the position to
/// have moved materially.
///
/// A deployment that can estimate the pending settlement registers an implementation; nothing is
/// registered by default and none is required. The tool answers with the official FINRA series
/// alone whenever no implementation is present, so this seam changes no existing output.
