/// Shared by the Yahoo key-stats sync and the financial-facts importer so the two writers of
/// <c>EquitySecurity.SharesOutstanding</c> apply one definition of "these figures are on different
/// bases" and can never fight each other across the same threshold.
///
/// The problem this solves: an issuer can list one security while its EDGAR cover page counts
/// another unit entirely. The form-based foreign-private-issuer guard catches 20-F/40-F filers,
/// but a former FPI that lost the status keeps filing 10-K/10-Q while its US listing is still an
/// ADS — AKTX files 10-Q covers of 91.6B ordinary shares against ~1.1M listed ADSs (80,000
/// ordinary per ADS since 2026-03-31).
///
/// Where the issuer's registered 12(b) title IS on record, callers ask it first
/// (<see cref="ListedSecurityClassifier.IsAmericanDepositary"/>) — it says what unit the listing
/// is quoted in, which no ratio can. This class is what remains when no title is on record, or
/// when the two counts disagree for a reason no title would explain (a dropped digit, a
/// thousands-scaled entry, a nominal placeholder): the mismatch is then detected from the figures
/// themselves. Deposit ratios are small enough to hide inside that tolerance, which is exactly
/// why the title has to be asked first rather than instead.
