/// Four populations, four phases:
/// <list type="number">
/// <item><b>Mis-published filed values</b> — rows a valuation decision site published as
/// <see cref="ValueSource.Filed"/> whose filed figure now looks thousands-scaled against an
/// available close (<see cref="HoldingValueSanityGuard.FiledLooksThousandsScaled"/>). The decision
/// is price-dependent, so it can be wrong in exactly one recoverable way: the price the decision
/// needed was missing or different when it ran (a price series still backfilling, a guard shipped
/// after the row was valued) and the row froze at the filer's thousands figure — 1,000× under
/// water — with nothing ever re-examining a settled Filed row. One production window minted 22k+
/// such rows on a single open quarter. The heal resets the row to pending so the recalculator
/// republishes the derivation under the shared guard — never publishing in-phase, which would be
/// a second implementation of the publish path free to drift from it.</item>
/// <item><b>Stuck zeros</b> — rows the repricing lane gave up on before the filed-value fallback
/// existed: <c>Value = 0</c>, not pending, not unavailable, with a perfectly good
/// <see cref="InstitutionalHolding.FiledValue"/> sitting unused in the same row. At its worst this
/// population was 48% of a whole quarter's positions, hiding real top holdings (a $11.9B NVDA
/// position sorted last) and understating every percentage. The heal publishes the filed figure.</item>
/// <item><b>Implausible derivations</b> — rows whose implied per-share price
/// (<c>Value / Shares</c>) exceeds <see cref="HoldingValueSanityGuard.MaxPlausibleSharePrice"/>.
/// One corrupt price series manufactured $102.8T of phantom value this way across 263 holders.
/// The heal resets them to pending so the recalculator re-derives them under its sanity guard
/// (which routes them to the filed value when the series is still corrupt).</item>
/// <item><b>Unmarked zeros</b> — the same abandoned population as phase 2 but with no filed
/// figure to publish. The ladder now stamps these <see cref="InstitutionalHolding.ValueUnavailable"/>
/// on exhaustion, but rows abandoned before that change are indistinguishable from "position
/// worth nothing", and every surface that discloses unvalued rows reads the flags. The heal
/// stamps them so one state has one representation.</item>
/// </list>
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// Phase 1 rules, each load-bearing:
/// <list type="bullet">
/// <item><b>Scope</b> is <c>ValueLastRetryAt == null</c> (with <c>Value == FiledValue</c> pinning
/// "the row still serves the filed figure" — the flush upsert historically did not carry
/// <see cref="ValueSource"/>, so a stale Filed label over a healthy derivation exists). The retry
/// ladder stamps <c>ValueLastRetryAt</c> on every advance, so ladder-exhaust publishes are outside
/// this phase by construction and remain the guard's documented accepted residual — a handful of
/// rows in production, priced never or too late, not the multi-million abandoned-zero population
/// (that one drained through phase 2 and carries a retry stamp anyway).</item>
/// <item><b>The thousands signature is corroborated per accession, never per row.</b> Thousands
/// reporting is a property of the filing's VALUE column: one in-band row alone can also be a
/// legitimately-Filed depositary row (~3,200× basis) whose stored price basis error happens to
/// land the recomputation inside the band — resetting that one would make the recalculator
/// publish a derivation ~1,000× the filer's own figure, terminally. A reset therefore requires
/// at least <see cref="MinCorroboratingRows"/> in-band rows making up at least
/// <see cref="CorroborationFraction"/> of the accession's priced rows in the batch (the
/// <c>Corrupt13FShareCountRepairer</c> pattern). Ambiguous in-band rows below that bar are
/// stamped instead — they keep serving the filer's own figure, and the quarterly bulk re-import
/// remains their healer.</item>
/// <item><b>Only a POSITIVE usable close examines a row.</b> The stamp is the one irreversible
/// decision in this lane (nothing but a re-import clears it), so it must never be taken on a
/// garbage price: a stored zero close derives 0, which is out-of-band, and would retire a
/// genuinely broken row forever. Zero/absent/implausible closes and unresolvable share-count
/// bases defer the row unstamped to a later cycle — the same deferral gates the recalculator
/// applies, so a reset row is always one it can republish.</item>
/// <item><b>The scan advances a wrap-around frontier</b> so permanently deferred rows (a price
/// series retired by the exact-listing cutover, an unresolvable secondary-listing split) cannot
/// pin the bounded window to the head of the Id order. Examined/stamped/deferred counts are
/// logged every non-empty cycle — a full window with a rising deferred count is the jam signal.</item>
/// </list>
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// Phases are isolated: one phase dying (the un-indexed scans routinely time out under
