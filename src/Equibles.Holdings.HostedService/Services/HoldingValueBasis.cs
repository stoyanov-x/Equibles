/// A holding's <c>Value</c> is derived as shares × a stored period close. The share count is as
/// filed, while the stored close has no basis metadata: Yahoo full-history reconciliation can
/// serve either an adjusted or as-traded series. <see cref="SplitBasisResolver"/> therefore proves
/// only the captured split factor and pending-marker state, not the close's actual basis.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// This legacy helper returns that captured split factor so the caller can fold it into the value
/// product without rounding the share count first. Applying it is not proof that the result matches
/// the stored close's basis and can double-apply a split when the provider served as-traded history;
/// the missing raw-price basis signal is tracked as a separate lane defect.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// A pending captured split remains an explicit ambiguity: the caller leaves that row pending
/// until reconciliation stamps the split. A completed stamp closes only that metadata window; it
/// still does not identify the provider-served raw-price basis.
