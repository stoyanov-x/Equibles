/// 32,098,694,296 Class A ordinary shares of NaaS — accurately, at 55.9% of the class — but NaaS
/// lists in the US as an American Depositary Share worth 3,200 ordinary shares, so pricing an
/// ordinary-share count at the ADS price produced a $100.8B position in a $38M company.

/// The test is arithmetic rather than a judgment: a single holder cannot own several times the

/// modelled, and inventing one would replace a wrong number with a different wrong number. The

/// the derived dollar figure, on the same principle as the day-change basis: a missing value is
