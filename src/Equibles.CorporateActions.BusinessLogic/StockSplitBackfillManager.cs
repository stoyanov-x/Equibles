// One-time historical stock-split backfill for a single stock. The incremental
// Yahoo price sync only captures split events inside its forward-only chart
// window (from the last stored price), so a split that predates a stock's first
// sync is never recorded — leaving every split-basis restatement (share counts,
// per-share figures, historical valuation ratios) with a silent factor-1 no-op.
// This manager issues ONE full-range chart request (since -> today, the same
// events=div|split fetch the price sync uses, sharing its client and therefore
// its rate limiter) and upserts the returned splits through the existing
// idempotent capture path — safe to re-run. Newly captured splits carry a null
// PriceAdjustmentAppliedTime, so the price sync's split reconciliation re-pulls
// those stocks' full provider-served history on its next cycles without further work.
