/// One materialised row per registered-fund series, derived from the latest NPORT-P report of
/// each series. Funds have no first-class entity of their own — identity is implicit across
/// <see cref="NportFiling"/> rows — so deriving the fund directory live would mean running the
/// correlated "latest report per series" scan (<c>NportFilingRepository.GetLatestPerSeries</c>)
/// on every browse request. This table holds one indexed row per series so the <c>/funds</c>
/// index and per-fund profile become plain lookups, the same way
/// <c>HolderQuarterlySnapshot</c> backs the institutions browse.
///
/// Rebuilt wholesale by <c>FundSeriesRefreshService</c>: every series' latest report is upserted
/// keyed by <see cref="IdentityKey"/> and rows left untouched by a run (stale series) are pruned
/// by the <see cref="ComputedAt"/> watermark.
///
/// Series identity never compares name text. Exactly one of the two populations applies per row:
/// an issuer-feed filing is scoped by <see cref="EquityIssuerId"/> plus its non-empty
/// <see cref="SeriesId"/> (or by stock alone for an id-less standalone fund); a fund-family trust
/// series discovered by the daily-index sweep is scoped by <see cref="RegistrantCik"/> plus
/// <see cref="SeriesId"/>. If a series has filings in both populations, the newest filing decides
/// which identity is materialised. For the sweep-discovered trusts only the holdings carrying a
/// tracked stock's CUSIP are stored, so <see cref="PositionCount"/> counts the fund's positions in
/// tracked stocks, not its whole portfolio; <see cref="NetAssets"/> and
/// <see cref="TotalAssets"/> are the fund's real totals from the report header regardless.
